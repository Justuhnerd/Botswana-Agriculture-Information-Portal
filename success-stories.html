Using the portal's weather updates and precision farming tips, Thandi implemented drip irrigation and adopted a soil health monitoring system in March 2023. She also started rotating her crops to maintain soil fertility. By March 2024, Thandi's maize yields had doubled, providing enough surplus to sell in the local market. Thandi's success story inspired other farmers in Serowe to adopt modern techniques. Her farm became a model for sustainable farming practices, and Thandi now mentors young farmers, helping them achieve similar success.</p>
